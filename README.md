# Tensorflow For House Numbers

## Summary ##

These notebooks detail the method used to pre-process data and construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) whose aim is to identify house numbers from photos. Those photos are made available in the SVHM dataset, which is from google streetview. 

### 96% Accuracy ###
The final model is 96% accurate, which is surprisingly good considering the 'entry level' PC and free software used. The hardware is a Windows 10 PC 64bit with Core i5-7500 (3.4GHz) 16Gb RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050Ti (4GB). The 1050Ti retails for GBP 135.00. Training in 20 epochs took 8hrs.

### Udacity 730 Capstone ###
The work is part of the capstone project for the [Udacity 730 Tensorflow](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) course. It follows the approach of the google research team in the paper [Goodfellow, et al 2013](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42241.pdf).

### R, not Python ###
Thanks to Tensorflow.rstudio.com, the project was completed in R, not Python. This may be the first attempt to complete Udacity 730's capstone in R.
